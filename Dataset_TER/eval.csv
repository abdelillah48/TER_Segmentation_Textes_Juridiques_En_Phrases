"opinion-G16-(Mathews v. Diaz, 426 U.S. 67.html",The District Court held that the first condition was unconstitutional and that it could not be severed from the second.,Giving the holding/ruling of a lower court

"opinion-G16-(Mathews v. Diaz, 426 U.S. 67.html","Specifically, they attack 42 U. S. C. § 1395o (2) (1970 ed., Supp. IV), which grants eligibility to resident citizents who are 65 or older but denies eligibility to comparable aliens unless they have been admitted for permanent residence and also have resided in the United States for at least five years.

Diaz, 426 U.S. 67.html","He sought relief on behalf of a class of persons who have been or will denied enrollment in the Medicare insurance program for failure to meet the requirements of 42 U. S. C. § 1395o (2) (1970 ed., Supp. IV).",Describing the legal arguments made in the present case
"opinion-G16-(Mathews v. Diaz, 426 U.S. 67.html","Since the complaint prayed for a declaration that § 1395o (2) was unconstitutional and for an injunction requiring the Secretary to approve all applicants who had been denied eligibility solely for failure to comply with its requirements, a three-judge court was constituted.",Describing procedural events
"opinion-G16-(Mathews v. Diaz, 426 U.S. 67.html","On September 28, 1972, the District Court granted leave to add Clara and Espinosa as plaintiffs and to file an amended complaint.",Describing procedural events
"opinion-G16-(Mathews v. Diaz, 426 U.S. 67.html","That pleading alleged that Clara had been denied enrollment for the same reasons as Diaz, but explained that Espinosa, although a permanent resident since 1971, had not attempted to enroll because he could not meet the durational residence requirement, and therefore any attempt would have been futile.",Describing the legal arguments made in the present case
"opinion-G16-(Mathews v. Diaz, 426 U.S. 67.html","The amended complaint sought relief on behalf of a subclass represented by Espinosathat is, aliens admitted for permanent residence who have been or will be denied enrollment for failure to meet the five-year continuous residence requirementas well as relief on behalf of the class represented by Diaz and Clara. [3]",Describing the legal arguments made in the present case
"opinion-G16-(Mathews v. Diaz, 426 U.S. 67.html","*72 On October 24, 1972, the Secretary moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground, among others, that the District Court lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter because none of the plaintiffs had exhausted his administrative remedies under the Social Security Act.",Describing the legal arguments made in the present case
"opinion-G16-(Mathews v. Diaz, 426 U.S. 67.html","Two days later, on October 26, 1972, Espinosa filed his application for enrollment with the Secretary.",Describing procedural events

"opinion-G16-(Mathews v.

Diaz, 426 U.S. 67.html","The District Court held that the five-year residence requirement violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment [5] and that since it could not be severed from the requirement of admission for permanent residence, the alien-eligibility provisions of § 1395o (2) (B) were entirely unenforceable.",Giving the holding/ruling of a lower court

"opinion-G16-(Mathews v. Diaz, 426 U.S. 67.html","The District Court reasoned that ""even though fourteenth amendment notions of equal protection are not entirely congruent with fifth amendment concepts of due process,"" id., at 9, the danger of unjustifiable discrimination against aliens in the enactment of welfare programs is so great, in view of their complete lack of representation in the political process, that this federal statute should be tested under the same pledge of equal protection as a state statute.",Giving the holding/ruling of a lower court
"opinion-G16-(Mathews v. Diaz, 426 U.S. 67.html","So tested, the court concluded that the statute was invalid because it was not both rationally based and free from invidious discrimination.",Giving the holding/ruling of a lower court

"opinion-G16-(Mathews v. Diaz, 426 U.S. 67.html","Espinosa's claim squarely raises the question whether the requirement of five years' continuous residence is constitutional, a question that is not necessarily presented by the claims of Diaz and Clara.",Stating the issue(s) to be decided
"opinion-G16-(Mathews v. Diaz, 426 U.S. 67.html","For if the requirement of admission for permanent residence is valid, their applications were properly denied even if the durational residence requirement is ineffective. [7]",Stating the Court's reasoning

"opinion-G16-(Mathews v. Diaz, 426 U.S. 67.html",We have little difficulty with Espinosa's failure to file an application with the Secretary until after he was joined in the action.,Accepting arguments/reasoning
"opinion-G16-(Mathews v. Diaz, 426 U.S. 67.html","Although 42 U. S. C. § 405 (g) establishes filing of an application as a nonwaivable condition of jurisdiction, Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.

"opinion-G16-(Mathews v. Diaz, 426 U.S. 67.html","since the record discloses, both by affidavit and stipulation, that the jurisdictional condition was satisfied, it is not too late, even now, to supplement the complaint to allege this fact. [9]",Stating the Court's reasoning

"opinion-G16-(Mathews v. Diaz, 426 U.S. 67.html",A further problem is presented by the absence of any formal administrative action by the Secretary denying Espinosa's application.,Stating the Court's reasoning

"opinion-G16-(Mathews v.
