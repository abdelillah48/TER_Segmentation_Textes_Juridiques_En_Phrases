ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.	Announcing function
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	A jury in New Hampshire Superior Court awarded respondent damages in this civil libel action based on one of petitioner's columns in the Laconia Evening Citizen.	Describing the adjudicated facts
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	Respondent alleged that the column contained defamatory falsehoods concerning his performance as Supervisor of the Belknap Country Recreation Area, a facility owned and operated by Belknap County.	Describing procedural events
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	In the interval between the trial and the decision of petitioner's appeal by the New Hampshire Supreme Court, we decided New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254 .	Describing the adjudicated facts
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	We there held that consistent with the First and Fourteenth Amendments a State cannot award damages to a public official for defamatory falsehood relating to his official conduct unless the official proves actual malicethat the falsehood was published with knowledge of its falsity or with reckless disregard of whether it was true or false.	Recalling a SCOTUS decision
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	The New Hampshire Supreme Court affirmed the award, finding New York Times no bar.	Giving the holding/ruling of a lower court
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	106 N. H. 26, 203 A. 2d 773.	Citing primary sources (other than SCOTUS decisions)
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	"We granted certiorari and requested the parties to brief and argue, in addition to the questions presented in the petition for certiorari, the question whether respondent was a ""public official"" under New York Times and under our decision in Garrison v. Louisiana, 379 U. S. 64 . 380 U. S. 941."	Granting certiorari
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	The Recreation Area was used principally as a ski resort but also for other recreational activities.	Giving the context
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	Respondent was employed by and directly responsible to the Belknap County Commissioners, three elected officials in charge of the county government.	Describing the adjudicated facts
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	During the 1950's, a public controversy developed over the way respondent and the Commissioners operated the Area; some protested that respondent and the Commissioners had not developed the *78 Area's full potential, either as a resort for local residents or as a tourist attraction that might contribute to the county's taxes.	Describing the adjudicated facts
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	some protested that respondent and the Commissioners had not developed the *78 Area's full potential, either as a resort for local residents or as a tourist attraction that might contribute to the county's taxes.	Describing the adjudicated facts
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	The discussion culminated in 1959, when the New Hampshire Legislature enacted a law transferring control of the Area to a special five-man commission. [1]	Giving the context
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	At least in part to give this new regime a fresh start, respondent was discharged.	Describing the adjudicated facts
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	Petitioner regularly contributed an unpaid column to the Laconia Evening Citizen.	Describing the adjudicated facts
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	In it he frequently commented on political matters.	Describing the adjudicated facts
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	As an outspoken proponent of the change in operations at the Recreation Area, petitioner's views were often sharply stated, and he had indicated disagreement with the actions taken by respondent and the County Commissioners.	Describing the adjudicated facts
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	In January 1960, during the first ski season under the new management, some six months after respondent's discharge, petitioner published the column that respondent alleges libeled him.	Describing the adjudicated facts
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	In relevant part, it reads:	Announcing function
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	"Been doing a little listening and checking at Belknap Recreation Area and am thunderstruck by what am learning. ""This year, a year without snow till very late, a year with actually few very major changes in procedure; the difference in cash income simply fantastic, almost unbelievable. ""On any sort of comparative basis, the Area this year is doing literally hundreds of per cent BETTER than last year. ""When consider that last year was excellent snow year, that season started because of more snow, months earlier last year, one can only ponder following question: ""What happened to all the money last year? and every other year? What magic has Dana Beane *79 [Chairman of the new commission] and rest of commission, and Mr. Warner [respondent's replacement as Supervisor] wrought to make such tremendous difference in net cash results?"	Quoting secondary sources
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	The column on its face contains no clearly actionable statement.	Stating the Court's reasoning
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	"Although the questions ""What happened to all the money last year? and every other year?"" could be read to imply peculation, they could also be read, in context, merely to praise the present administration."	Stating the Court's reasoning
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	The only persons mentioned by name are officials of the new regime; no reference is made to respondent, the three elected commissioners, or anyone else who had a part in the administration of the Area during respondent's tenure.	Recalling a fact or procedural event
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	no reference is made to respondent, the three elected commissioners, or anyone else who had a part in the administration of the Area during respondent's tenure	Recalling a fact or procedural event
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	"Persons familiar with the controversy over the Area might well read it as complimenting the luck or skill of the new management in attracting increased patronage and producing a ""tremendous difference in net cash results"" despite less favorable snow; indeed, witnesses for petitioner testified that they so read the column."	Stating the Court's reasoning
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	indeed, witnesses for petitioner testified that they so read the column.	Describing the adjudicated facts
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	Respondent offered extrinsic proofs to supply a defamatory meaning.	Describing procedural events
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	These proofs were that the column greatly exaggerated any improvement under the new regime, and that a large part of the community understood it to say that the asserted improvements were not explicable by anything the new management had done.	Describing procedural events
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	Rather, his witnesses testified, they read the column as imputing mismanagement and peculation during respondent's tenure.	Describing the adjudicated facts
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	Respondent urged two theories to support a recovery based on that imputation.	Describing procedural events
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	The first was that the jury could award him damages if it found that the column cast suspicion indiscriminately *80 on the small number of persons who composed the former management group, whether or not it found that the imputation of misconduct was specifically made of and concerning him. [2]	Recalling an argument from the respondent
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	"This theory of recovery was open to respondent under New Hampshire law; the trial judge explicitly instructed the jury that ""an imputation of impropriety or a crime to one or some of a small group that casts suspicion upon all is actionable."" [3]"	Describing primary sources (other than SCOTUS decisions)
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	The question is presented, however, whether that theory of recovery is precluded by our holding in New York Times that, in the absence of sufficient evidence that the attack focused on the plaintiff, an otherwise impersonal attack on governmental operations cannot be utilized to establish a libel of those administering the operations.	Recalling a SCOTUS decision
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	376 U. S., at 290-292 .	Citing a SCOTUS decision
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	The plaintiff in New York Times was one of the three elected Commissioners of the City of Montgomery, Alabama.	Giving the facts of another case
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	His duties included the supervision of the police department.	Giving the facts of another case
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	"The statements in the advertisement upon which he principally relied as referring to him were that ""truckloads of police . . . ringed the Alabama State College Campus"" after a demonstration on the State Capitol steps, and that Dr. Martin Luther King had been ""arrested . . . seven times."""	Giving the facts of another case
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	"These statements were false in that although the police had been ""deployed near the campus,"" they had not actually ""ringed"" it and had not gone there in connection with a State Capitol demonstration, and in that Dr. King had been arrested only *81 four times."	Giving the facts of another case
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	"We held that evidence that Sullivan as Police Commissioner was the supervisory head of the Police Department was constitutionally insufficient to show that the statements about police activity were ""of and concerning"" him; we rejected as inconsistent with the First and Fourteenth Amendments the proposition followed by the Alabama Supreme Court in the case that ""[i]n measuring the performance or deficiencies of . . . groups, praise or criticism is usually attached to the official in complete control of the body,"""	Recalling a SCOTUS decision
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	"we rejected as inconsistent with the First and Fourteenth Amendments the proposition followed by the Alabama Supreme Court in the case that ""[i]n measuring the performance or deficiencies of . . . groups, praise or criticism is usually attached to the official in complete control of the body,"" 273 Ala. 656, 674-675, 144 So. 2d 25, 39."	Recalling a SCOTUS decision
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	To allow the jury to connect the statements with Sullivan on that presumption alone was, in our view, to invite the spectre of prosecutions for libel on government, which the Constitution does not tolerate in any form.	Recalling a SCOTUS decision

ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	376 U. S., at 292 .	Citing a SCOTUS decision
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	There must be evidence showing that the attack was read as specifically directed at the plaintiff.	Recalling a SCOTUS decision
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	Were the statement at issue in this case an explicit charge that the Commissioners and Baer or the entire Area management were corrupt, we assume without deciding that any member of the identified group might recover. [5]	Stating the Court's reasoning
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	The statement itself might be sufficient evidence that the attack was specifically directed at each individual.	Stating the Court's reasoning
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	Even if a charge and reference were merely implicit, as is alleged here, but a plaintiff could show by extrinsic proofs that the statement referred to him, it would be no defense to a suit by one member of an *82 identifiable group engaged in governmental activity that another was also attacked.	Stating the Court's reasoning
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	These situations are distinguishable from the present case; here, the jury was permitted to infer both defamatory content and reference from the challenged statement itself, although the statement on its face is only an impersonal discussion of government activity.	Stating the Court's reasoning
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	To the extent the trial judge authorized the jury to award respondent a recovery without regard to evidence that the asserted implication of the column was made specifically of and concerning him, we hold that the instruction was erroneous. [6]	Giving the holding/ruling of the Court
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	Here, no explicit charge of peculation was made; no assault on the previous management appears.	Recalling a fact or procedural event
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	The jury was permitted to award damages upon a finding merely that respondent was one of a small group acting for an organ of government, only some of whom were implicated, but all of whom were tinged with suspicion.	Recalling a fact or procedural event
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	In effect, this permitted the jury to find liability merely on the basis of his relationship to the government agency, the operations of which were the subject of discussion.	Recalling a fact or procedural event
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	It is plain that the elected Commissioners, also members of that group, *83 would have been barred from suit on this theory under New York Times.	Stating the Court's reasoning
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	They would be required to show specific reference.	Stating the Court's reasoning
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	Whether or not respondent was a public official, as a member of the group he bears the same burden. [7]	Stating the Court's reasoning
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	A theory that the column cast indiscriminate suspicion on the members of the group responsible for the conduct of this governmental operation is tantamount to a demand for recovery based on libel of government, and therefore is constitutionally insufficient.	Stating the Court's reasoning
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	Since the trial judge's instructions were erroneous in this respect, the judgment must be reversed.	Giving the holding/ruling of the Court
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	"Respondent's second theory, supported by testimony of several witnesses, was that the column was read as referring specifically to him, as the ""man in charge"" at the Area, personally responsible for its financial affairs."	Recalling an argument from the respondent
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	Even accepting respondent's reading, the column manifestly discusses the conduct of operations of government. [8]	Recalling a fact or procedural event
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	The subject matter may have been only of local interest, but at least here, where publication was addressed primarily to the interested community, that fact is constitutionally irrelevant.	Stating the Court's reasoning
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	"The question is squarely presented whether the ""public official"" designation under New York Times applies."	Recalling a SCOTUS decision
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	If it does, it is clear that the jury instructions were improper.	Stating the Court's reasoning
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	Under the instructions, the jury was permitted *84 to find that negligent misstatement of fact would defeat petitioner's privilege.	Recalling a fact or procedural event
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	"That test was rejected in Garrison, 379 U. S., at 79 , where we said, ""The test which we laid down in New York Times is not keyed to ordinary care; defeasance of the privilege is conditioned, not on mere negligence, but on reckless disregard for the truth."""	Recalling a SCOTUS decision
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	"The trial court also charged that ""[d]efamatory matter which constitutes comment rather than fact is justified if made without malice and represented fair comment on matters of public interest,"" and defined malice to include ""ill will, evil motive, intention to injure . . . ."""	Recalling a fact or procedural event
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	"This definition of malice is constitutionally insufficient where discussion of public affairs is concerned; ""[w]e held in New York Times that a public official might be allowed the civil remedy only if he establishes that the utterance was false and that it was made with knowledge of its falsity or in reckless disregard of whether it was false or true."""	Rejecting arguments/a reasoning
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	Garrison, 379 U. S., at 74 .	Citing a SCOTUS decision
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	"Turning, then, to the question whether respondent was a ""public official"" within New York Times, we reject at the outset his suggestion that it should be answered by reference to state-law standards."	Rejecting arguments/a reasoning
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	"States have developed definitions of ""public official"" for local administrative purposes, not the purposes of a national constitutional protection. [9]"	Referring to unwritten sources of authority
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	If existing state-law standards reflect the purposes of New York Times, this is at best accidental.	Stating the Court's reasoning
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	Our decision in New York Times, moreover, draws its force from the constitutional protections afforded free expression.	Recalling a SCOTUS decision
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	"The standards that set the scope of its principles cannot therefore be such that ""the constitutional limits of free expression in the Nation would vary with state lines."""	Stating the Court's reasoning

ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	"*85 We remarked in New York Times that we had no occasion ""to determine how far down into the lower ranks of government employees the `public official' designation would extend for purposes of this rule, or otherwise to specify categories of persons who would or would not be included."""

ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	No precise lines need be drawn for the purposes of this case.	Stating the Court's reasoning
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	The motivating force for the decision in New York Times was twofold.	Announcing function
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	"We expressed ""a profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open, and that [such debate] may well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials."""	Recalling a SCOTUS decision
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	376 U. S., at 270 .	Citing a SCOTUS decision
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	There is, first, a strong interest in debate on public issues, and, second, a strong interest in debate about those persons who are in a position significantly to influence the resolution of those issues.	Stating the Court's reasoning
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	Criticism of government is at the very center of the constitutionally protected area of free discussion.	Stating the Court's reasoning
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	Criticism of those responsible for government operations must be free, lest criticism of government itself be penalized.	Stating the Court's reasoning
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	"t is clear, therefore, that the ""public official"" designation applies at the very least to those among the hierarchy of government employees who have, or appear to the public to have, substantial responsibility for or control over the conduct of governmental affairs. [11]"	Stating an intermediate conclusion
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	*86 This conclusion does not ignore the important social values which underlie the law of defamation.	Referring to unwritten sources of authority
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	Society has a pervasive and strong interest in preventing and redressing attacks upon reputation.	Referring to unwritten sources of authority
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	But in cases like the present, there is tension between this interest and the values nurtured by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.	Stating the Court's reasoning
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	The thrust of New York Times is that when interests in public discussion are particularly strong, as they were in that case, the Constitution limits the protections afforded by the law of defamation.	Recalling a SCOTUS decision
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	Where a position in government has such apparent importance that the public has an independent interest in the qualifications and performance of the person who holds it, beyond the general public interest in the qualifications and performance of all government employees, both elements we identified in New York Times are present [12] and the New York Times malice standards apply. [13]	Recalling a SCOTUS decision
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	*87 As respondent framed his case, he may have held such a position.	Stating the Court's reasoning
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	"Since New York Times had not been decided when his case went to trial, his presentation was not shaped to the ""public official"" issue."	Recalling a fact or procedural event
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	He did, however, seek to show that the article referred particularly to him.	Recalling a fact or procedural event
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	His theory was that his role in the management of the Area was so prominent and important that the public regarded him as the man responsible for its operations, chargeable with its failures and to be credited with its successes.	Recalling a fact or procedural event
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	"Thus, to prove the article referred to him, he showed the importance of his role; the same showing, at the least, raises a substantial argument that he was a ""public official."" [14]"	Recalling a primary source (other than a SCOTUS decision)
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	The record here, however, leaves open the possibility that respondent could have adduced proofs to bring his claim outside the New York Times rule.	Stating the Court's reasoning
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	Moreover, even if the claim falls within New York Times, the record suggests respondent may be able to present a jury question of malice as there defined.	Stating the Court's reasoning
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	Because the trial here was had before New York Times, we have concluded that we should not foreclose him from attempting retrial of his *88 action.	Giving the holding/ruling of the Court
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	"We remark only that, as is the case with questions of privilege generally, it is for the trial judge in the first instance to determine whether the proofs show respondent to be a ""public official."" [15]"	Giving the holding/ruling of the Court
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	The judgment is reversed and the case remanded to the New Hampshire Supreme Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.	Giving the holding/ruling of the Court
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL	It is so ordered.	Giving the holding/ruling of the Court
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.	Announcing function
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	These cases involve 42 U.S. C . §262(l), which was en- acted as part of the Biologics Price Competition and Inno- vation Act of 2009 (BPCIA), 124 Stat. 808.	Describing primary sources (other than SCOTUS decisions)
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	The BPCIA governs a type of drug called a biosimilar, which is a biologic product that is highly similar to a biologic product that has already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).	Describing primary sources (other than SCOTUS decisions)
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	Under §262(l), an applicant that seeks FDA approval of a biosimilar must provide its appli- cation materials and manufacturing information to the manufacturer of the corresponding biologic within 20 days of the date the FDA notifies the applicant that it has accepted the application for review.	Describing primary sources (other than SCOTUS decisions)
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	The applicant then must give notice to the manufacturer at least 180 days before marketing the biosimilar commercially.	Describing primary sources (other than SCOTUS decisions)
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	The first question presented by these cases is whether the requirement that an applicant provide its application and manufacturing information to the manufacturer of the biologic is enforceable by injunction.	Stating the issue(s) to be decided
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	We conclude that an injunction is not available under federal law, but we re- mand for the court below to decide whether an injunction is available under state law.	Giving the holding/ruling of the Court
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	The second question is whether the applicant must give notice to the manufac- turer after, rather than before, obtaining a license from the FDA for its biosimilar. We conclude that an applicant may provide notice before obtaining a license.	Stating the issue(s) to be decided
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	We conclude that an applicant may provide notice before obtaining a license.	Giving the holding/ruling of the Court
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	The complex statutory scheme at issue in these cases establishes processes both for obtaining FDA approval of biosimilars and for resolving patent disputes between manufacturers of licensed biologics and manufacturers of biosimilars.	Giving the context
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	Before turning to the questions presented, we first explain the statutory background.	Announcing function
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	A biologic is a type of drug derived from natural, biologi- cal sources such as animals or microorganisms.	Giving the context
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	iologics thus differ from traditional drugs, which are typically synthesized from chemicals.1	Giving the context
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	A manufacturer of a biologic may market the drug only if the FDA has licensed it pur- suant to either of two review processes set forth in §262.	Describing primary sources (other than SCOTUS decisions)
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	The default pathway for approval, used for new biologics, is set forth in §262(a).	Describing primary sources (other than SCOTUS decisions)
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	Under that subsection, the FDA may license a new biologic if, among other things, the manufacturer demonstrates that it is “safe, pure, and potent.”	Describing primary sources (other than SCOTUS decisions)
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	§262(a)(2)(C)(i)(I).	Citing primary sources (other than SCOTUS decisions)
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	In addition to this default route, the statute also prescribes an alternative, abbrevi- ated route for FDA approval of biosimilars, which is set forth in §262(k).	Describing primary sources (other than SCOTUS decisions)
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	To obtain approval through the BPCIA’s abbreviated process, the manufacturer of a biosimilar (applicant) does not need to show that the product is “safe, pure, and po- tent.”	Describing primary sources (other than SCOTUS decisions)
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	Instead, the applicant may piggyback on the show- ing made by the manufacturer (sponsor) of a previously licensed biologic (reference product).	Describing primary sources (other than SCOTUS decisions)
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	See §262(k)(2)(A)(iii).	Citing primary sources (other than SCOTUS decisions)

Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	Under §262(l)(9)(C), if an applicant fails to provide its application and manufacturing information to the sponsor—thus effectively pretermitting the entire two-phase litigation process—then the sponsor, but not the applicant, may immediately bring an action “for a declaration of infringement, validity, or enforceability of any patent that claims the biological product or a use of the biological product.”	Describing primary sources (other than SCOTUS decisions)
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	Section 271(e)(2)(C)(ii) facilitates this action by making it an artificial act of infringement, with respect to any patent that could have been included on the §262(l)(3) lists, to submit a biosimilar application.	Describing primary sources (other than SCOTUS decisions)
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	Similarly, when an applicant provides the application and manufacturing information but fails to complete a subse- quent step, §262(l)(9)(B) provides that the sponsor, but not the applicant, may bring a declaratory-judgment action with respect to any patent included on the sponsor’s §262(l)(3)(A) list of patents (as well as those it acquired later and added to the list).	Describing primary sources (other than SCOTUS decisions)

Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	In May 2014, Sandoz, the petitioner in No. 15–1039 and the respondent in No. 15– 1195, filed an application with the FDA seeking approval to market a filgrastim biosimilar under the brand name Zarxio, with Neupogen as the reference product.

Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	580 U. S. ___ (2017).	Citing a SCOTUS decision
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	The first question we must answer is whether §262(l)(2)(A)’s requirement that an applicant provide the sponsor with its application and manufacturing infor- mation is enforceable by an injunction under either federal or state law.	Stating the issue(s) to be decided
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	We agree with the Federal Circuit that an injunction under federal law is not available to enforce §262(l)(2)(A), though for slightly different reasons than those provided by the court below.	Accepting arguments/reasoning
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	he Federal Circuit held that “ 42 U.S. C . §262(l)(9)(C) and 35 U.S. C . §271(e) expressly provide the only remedies” for a violation of §262(l)(2)(A), 794 F.3d, at 1357 , and neither of those provisions author- izes a court to compel compliance with §262(l)(2)(A).

Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	In concluding that the remedies specified in the BPCIA are exclusive, the Federal Circuit relied primarily on §271(e)(4), which states that it provides “ ‘the only reme- dies which may be granted by a court for an act of [artifi- cial] infringement.’ ”	Recalling a primary source (other than a SCOTUS decision)
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	Id., at 1356 (emphasis deleted).	Citing primary sources (other than SCOTUS decisions)
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	The flaw in the Federal Circuit’s reasoning is that Sandoz’s failure to disclose its application and manufac- turing information was not an act of artificial infringe- ment, and thus was not remediable under §271(e)(4).	Stating the Court's reasoning
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	Submitting an application constitutes an act of artificial infringement.	Recalling a primary source (other than a SCOTUS decision)

Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	The italicized language merely assists in identifying which patents will be the subject of the artificial infringement suit.	Stating the Court's reasoning
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	It does not define the act of artificial infringement itself.	Stating the Court's reasoning
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	This conclusion follows from the structure of §271(e)(2)(C).	Announcing function
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	Clause (i) of §271(e)(2)(C) defines artificial infringement in the situation where the parties proceed through the list exchange process and the patents subject to suit are those contained in the §262(l)(3) lists, as sup- plemented under §262(l)(7).	Describing primary sources (other than SCOTUS decisions)
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	That clause provides that it is an act of artificial infringement to submit, “with respect to a patent that is identified in the list of patents described in [§262(l)(3)] (including as provided under [§262(l)(7)]), an application seeking approval of a biological product.”	Recalling a primary source (other than a SCOTUS decision)
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	Clause (ii) of §271(e)(2)(C), in contrast, defines artificial infringement in the situation where an applicant fails to disclose its application and manufactur- ing information altogether and the parties never prepare the §262(l)(3) lists.	Recalling a primary source (other than a SCOTUS decision)
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	That clause provides that the submis- sion of the application represents an act of artificial in- fringement with respect to any patent that could have been included on the lists.	Recalling a primary source (other than a SCOTUS decision)
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	In this way, the two clauses of §271(e)(2)(C) work in tandem.	Stating the Court's reasoning
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	They both treat submission of the application as the act of artificial infringement for which §271(e)(4) provides the remedies.	Recalling a primary source (other than a SCOTUS decision)
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	And they both identify the patents subject to suit, although by different means depending on whether the applicant disclosed its application and manu- facturing information under §262(l)(2)(A).	Recalling a primary source (other than a SCOTUS decision)
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	If the applicant made the disclosures, clause (i) applies; if it did not, clause (ii) applies.	Recalling a primary source (other than a SCOTUS decision)
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	In neither instance is the applicant’s failure to provide its application and manufacturing information an element of the act of artificial infringement, and in neither instance does §271(e)(4) provide a remedy for that failure.

Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	See Brief for Amgen Inc. et al. 66–67 (conceding both points).	I have a doubt
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	A separate provision of §262, however, does provide a remedy for an applicant’s failure to turn over its applica- tion and manufacturing information.	Recalling a primary source (other than a SCOTUS decision)
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	When an applicant fails to comply with §262(l)(2)(A), §262(l)(9)(C) authorizes the sponsor, but not the applicant, to bring an immediate declaratory-judgment action for artificial infringement as defined in §271(e)(2)(C)(ii).	Recalling a primary source (other than a SCOTUS decision)

Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	The presence of §262(l)(9)(C), coupled with the absence of any other textually specified remedies, indicates that Congress did not intend sponsors to have access to injunctive relief, at least as a matter of federal law, to enforce the disclosure requirement.	Stating the Court's reasoning
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	Statutory context further confirms that Congress did not authorize courts to enforce §262(l)(2)(A) by injunction.	Stating the Court's reasoning
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	Section 262(l)(1)(H) provides that “the court shall consider immediate injunctive relief to be an appropriate and nec- essary remedy for any violation or threatened violation” of the rules governing the confidentiality of information disclosed under §262(l).

Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	As we have explained, failure to com- ply with §262(l)(2)(A) is not an act of artificial infringe- ment.	Recalling a primary source (other than a SCOTUS decision)
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	Because §271(e)(4) provides remedies only for artificial infringement, it provides no remedy at all, much less an “expressly . . . exclusive” one, for Sandoz’s failure to comply with §262(l)(2)(A).	Recalling a primary source (other than a SCOTUS decision)
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	Second, the Federal Circuit held in the alternative that Sandoz’s failure to disclose its application and manufac- turing information was not “unlawful” under California’s unfair competition law.	Giving the holding/ruling of a lower court
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	In the court’s view, when an applicant declines to provide its application and manufac- turing information to the sponsor, it takes a path “expressly contemplated by” §262(l)(9)(C) and §271(e)(2)(C)(ii) and thus does not violate the BPCIA. 794 F.3d, at 1357 , 1360.

Recalling an argument from the respondent
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	If it is only a condition precedent, then an applicant effectively has the option to withhold its application and manufactur- ing information and does not commit an “unlawful” act in doing so.	Stating the Court's reasoning
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	We decline to resolve this particular dispute definitively because it does not present a question of federal law.	Stating the issue(s) to be decided
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	The BPCIA, standing alone, does not require a court to decide whether §262(l)(2)(A) is mandatory or conditional; the court need only determine whether the applicant supplied the sponsor with the information required under §262(l)(2)(A).	Recalling a primary source (other than a SCOTUS decision)

Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	There is no dispute about how the federal scheme actually works, and thus nothing for us to decide as a matter of federal law.	Stating the Court's reasoning
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	The mandatory or conditional nature of the BPCIA’s requirements matters only for purposes of Cali- fornia’s unfair competition law, which penalizes “unlaw- ful” conduct.	Recalling a primary source (other than a SCOTUS decision)
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	Whether Sandoz’s conduct was “unlawful” under the unfair competition law is a state-law question, and the court below erred in attempting to answer that question by referring to the BPCIA alone.	Stating the Court's reasoning
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	On remand, the Federal Circuit should determine whether California law would treat noncompliance with §262(l)(2)(A) as “unlawful.”	Giving instructions to the courts below
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	If the answer is yes, then the court should proceed to determine whether the BPCIA pre-empts any additional remedy available under state law for an applicant’s failure to comply with §262(l)(2)(A) (and whether Sandoz has forfeited any pre-emption de- fense, see 794 F.3d, at 1360 , n. 5).	Giving instructions to the courts below
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	The court is also of course free to address the pre-emption question first by assuming that a remedy under state law exists.	Giving instructions to the courts below
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	The second question at issue in these cases is whether an applicant must provide notice after the FDA licenses its biosimilar, or if it may also provide effective notice before licensure.	Stating the issue(s) to be decided
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	Section 262(l)(8)(A) states that the applicant “shall provide notice to the reference product sponsor not later than 180 days before the date of the first commercial marketing of the biological product licensed under subsec- tion (k).”	Recalling a primary source (other than a SCOTUS decision)
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	The Federal Circuit held that an applicant’s biosimilar must already be “licensed” at the time the applicant gives notice.	Giving the holding/ruling of a lower court

Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	“[C]ommercial marketing,” in turn, must be “of the biological product licensed under subsection (k).”	Recalling a primary source (other than a SCOTUS decision)
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	§262(l)(8)(A).	Citing primary sources (other than SCOTUS decisions)
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	Because this latter phrase modifies “com- mercial marketing” rather than “notice,” “commercial marketing” is the point in time by which the biosimilar must be “licensed.”	Recalling a primary source (other than a SCOTUS decision)
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	The statute’s use of the word “li- censed” merely reflects the fact that, on the “date of the first commercial marketing,” the product must be “li- censed.”	Recalling a primary source (other than a SCOTUS decision)
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	See §262(a)(1)(A).	Citing primary sources (other than SCOTUS decisions)
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	Accordingly, the applicant may provide notice either before or after receiving FDA approval.	Recalling a primary source (other than a SCOTUS decision)
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	Statutory context confirms this interpretation.	Stating the Court's reasoning
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	Section 262(l)(8)(A) contains a single timing requirement: The applicant must provide notice at least 180 days prior to marketing its biosimilar.	Recalling a primary source (other than a SCOTUS decision)
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	The Federal Circuit, however, interpreted the provision to impose two timing require- ments: The applicant must provide notice after the FDA licenses the biosimilar and at least 180 days before the applicant markets the biosimilar.	Recalling a primary source (other than a SCOTUS decision)
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	An adjacent provision expressly sets forth just that type of dual timing require- ment.	Recalling a primary source (other than a SCOTUS decision)
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	See §262(l)(8)(B) (“After receiving notice under subparagraph (A) and before such date of the first com- mercial marketing of such biological product, the reference product sponsor may seek a preliminary injunction” (em- phasis added)).

Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	Brief for Amgen Inc. et al. 28 (emphasis added).	I have a doubt
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	In its view, this variation “is a strong textual indication that §262(l)(8)(A), unlike the other provisions, refers to a product that has already been ‘licensed’ by the FDA.”	Recalling an argument from the respondent
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	Ibid.	I have a doubt
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	Amgen’s interpretation is not necessary to harmonize Congress’ use of the two different phrases.	Recalling an argument from the respondent
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	The provision upon which Amgen primarily relies (and that is generally illustrative of the other provisions it cites) requires the applicant to explain why the sponsor’s patents are “ ‘inva- lid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed by the commer- cial marketing of the biological product that is the subject of the subsection (k) application.’ ”	Recalling an argument from the respondent
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	Id., at 29–30 (quoting §262(l)(3)(B)(ii)(I); emphasis deleted).	I have a doubt
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	This provision uses the phrase “subject of the subsection (k) application” rather than “product licensed under subsection (k)” be- cause the applicant can evaluate validity, enforceability, and infringement with respect to the biosimilar only as it exists when the applicant is conducting the evaluation, which it does before licensure.	Describing primary sources (other than SCOTUS decisions)
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	The applicant cannot make the same evaluation with respect to the biosimilar as it will exist after licensure, because the biosimilar’s specifi- cations may change during the application process.	Describing primary sources (other than SCOTUS decisions)

Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	See Brief for Amgen Inc. et al. 35–42.	I have a doubt
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	Sandoz and the Government, in turn, respond with their own bevy of arguments that Amgen’s concerns are misplaced and that prelicensure notice af- firmatively furthers Congress’ intent.	Recalling an argument from the petitioner

Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	The plausibility of the contentions on both sides illustrates why such disputes are appropriately addressed to Congress, not the courts.	Determining jurisdiction
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	Even if we were persuaded that Amgen had the better of the policy argu- ments, those arguments could not overcome the statute’s plain language, which is our “primary guide” to Congress’ preferred policy.	Presenting an argument from the dissenters
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	McFarland v. Scott, 512 U.S. 849 , 865 (1994) (THOMAS, J., dissenting).	Citing secondary sources
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	In sum, because Sandoz fully complied with §262(l)(8)(A) when it first gave notice (before licensure) in July 2014, the Federal Circuit erred in issuing a federal injunction prohibiting Sandoz from marketing Zarxio until 180 days after licensure.	Giving the holding/ruling of the Court
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	Furthermore, because Amgen’s request for state-law relief is predicated on its argument that the BPCIA forbids prelicensure notice, its claim under California’s unfair competition law also fails.	Giving the holding/ruling of the Court
Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc_MCL	We accordingly reverse the Federal Circuit’s judgment as to the notice provision.	Giving the holding/ruling of the Court

opinion-G16-(United States v.

opinion-G16-(United States v. Mississippi Chemical	The greatest difficulty in the establishment of a rural-credit system, based upon the cooperative principle, is met in connection with the inauguration of the system. Ample capital is absolutely necessary at the start and whatever sums the first borrowers might be able to contribute would in no wise suffice to get the system into successful operation. The system must be endowed, temporarily at least, with capital from sources other than the subscriptions to capital stock among the borrowers.	Quoting secondary sources

opinion-G16-(United States v. Mississippi Chemical	One notable difference between the 1916 and the 1933 Acts was that the latter did not regulate the membership of the cooperative association to any great degree.	Describing primary sources (other than SCOTUS decisions)
opinion-G16-(United States v.

opinion-G16-(United States v. Mississippi Chemical	Only the tax treatment of the quarterly purchases is disputed here. [11]	Stating the issue(s) to be decided
opinion-G16-(United States v. Mississippi Chemical	The taxpayers correctly note that the Class C stock has attributes which would make a normal commercial stock undesirable.	Recalling an argument from the respondent
opinion-G16-(United States v. Mississippi Chemical	For example, the C stock pays no dividends; [12] it is transferable *308 only between cooperatives and only under rare circumstances; additional shares do not provide additional voting power; [13] and the stock cannot be redeemed until all A, all B issued earlier or in the same year, and all earlier issued C shares have been called for redemption.	Recalling an argument from the respondent
opinion-G16-(United States v. Mississippi Chemical	These characteristics render the market for C shares virtually nonexistent.	Stating the Court's reasoning
opinion-G16-(United States v. Mississippi Chemical	It must be remembered, however, that the stock was intentionally given these characteristics by a Congress with definite goals in mind. [14]	Stating the Court's reasoning
opinion-G16-(United States v. Mississippi Chemical	The legislative history of the Farm Credit Act of 1955 indicates that Congress placed much of the blame for the Bank's inability to *309 repay the capital extended by the Government and to retain private capital on the provision in the 1933 legislation which permitted borrowers to redeem their stock for cash upon paying off their loans.	Referring to unwritten sources of authority
opinion-G16-(United States v. Mississippi Chemical	The restrictions on redemption and transferability and the dividend prohibition were designed to obviate this difficulty and to provide both a stable membership and permanent capital, two necessities for the success of any cooperative venture.	Referring to unwritten sources of authority
opinion-G16-(United States v. Mississippi Chemical	The taxpayers do not seek to deduct the cost of their initial shares in the Bank as interest.	Recalling an argument from the respondent
opinion-G16-(United States v. Mississippi Chemical	They accept the fact that these shares represent one cost of membership and that this cost is a capital expense because membership is a valuable asset in more than one taxable year.	Recalling an argument from the respondent
opinion-G16-(United States v. Mississippi Chemical	But, they argue that once they purchased their initial shares, they obtained full membership rights, and, a fortiori, that Congress must have intended the quarterly expenditures for stock to be a charge for borrowing money since the stock has no value.	Recalling an argument from the respondent
opinion-G16-(United States v. Mississippi Chemical	The fact is, however, that the stock purchased quarterly is indeed valuable.	Rejecting arguments/a reasoning
opinion-G16-(United States v. Mississippi Chemical	The amounts paid for C shares become part of the permanent capital structure of the Bank, thereby increasing the stability of the Bank and insuring its continued ability to extend credit.	Stating the Court's reasoning
opinion-G16-(United States v. Mississippi Chemical	Each share also provides an opportunity for more patronage and surplus dividends, an ultimate right of redemption, and an asset that may be used as a set-off in case of a default on the loan.	Stating the Court's reasoning
opinion-G16-(United States v. Mississippi Chemical	In sum, every share of stock purchased quarterly by the taxpayers is nearly as valuable as the shares purchased initially.	Stating the Court's reasoning
opinion-G16-(United States v. Mississippi Chemical	It is therefore difficult to understand why these different purchases should receive radically different tax treatment.	Stating the Court's reasoning
opinion-G16-(United States v. Mississippi Chemical	If Congress had required 1,000 or 100,000 shares of Class C stock to be purchased *310 before an association could borrow from the Banks, under the taxpayers' theory of the case the cost of those shares would be a nondeductible capital expense.	Stating the Court's reasoning
opinion-G16-(United States v. Mississippi Chemical	Simply because Congress eased the burden on farmers by spreading the requirement of capital investment over a period of time rather than requiring it as a prerequisite to borrowing, the taxpayers are entitled to no more favorable tax treatment.	Stating the Court's reasoning
opinion-G16-(United States v. Mississippi Chemical	It is important not to lose sight of the congressional purposes in enacting the farm credit legislation.	Stating the Court's reasoning
opinion-G16-(United States v. Mississippi Chemical	The immediate goal was to provide loans to farmers at low interest rates.	Stating the Court's reasoning
opinion-G16-(United States v. Mississippi Chemical	"It would, therefore, be odd for Congress to provide a ""hidden"" interest charge in the legislation."	Stating the Court's reasoning

opinion-G16-(United States v. Mississippi Chemical	Congress felt, in light of its experience under the Farm Credit Act of 1933, that the long-range goal could only be achieved if Bank members made longterm investments in the Banks.	Stating the Court's reasoning
opinion-G16-(United States v. Mississippi Chemical	Hence, Congress created Class C stock, a security with a special value in cooperative ventures.	Stating the Court's reasoning
opinion-G16-(United States v. Mississippi Chemical	While this security is sui generis, the congressional scheme makes it clear that it has value over the long run.	Stating the Court's reasoning
opinion-G16-(United States v. Mississippi Chemical	Since the security is of value in more than one taxable year, it is a capital asset within the meaning of § 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code, and its cost is nondeductible.	Recalling a SCOTUS decision

opinion-G16-(United States v. Mississippi Chemical	We reject the contention that while the Class C *311 stock may be a capital asset, it is worth only $1, [15] and that the additional $99 paid for each share must represent interest.	Rejecting arguments/a reasoning
opinion-G16-(United States v. Mississippi Chemical	Were we dealing with the traditional corporate structure in this case, the taxpayers' argument would have strength.	Stating the Court's reasoning
opinion-G16-(United States v. Mississippi Chemical	But, as we have pointed out previously, the essential nature of cooperatives and corporations differs.	Recalling a primary source (other than a SCOTUS decision)
opinion-G16-(United States v. Mississippi Chemical	The value of the Class C stock derives primarily from attributes other than marketability.	Stating the Court's reasoning
opinion-G16-(United States v. Mississippi Chemical	The stock has value because it is the foundation of the cooperative scheme; it insures stability and continuity.	Stating the Court's reasoning
opinion-G16-(United States v. Mississippi Chemical	The stock also has value because it enables the farmers to work together toward common goals.	Stating the Court's reasoning
opinion-G16-(United States v. Mississippi Chemical	It enables them to share in a venture of common concerns and to reap the rewards of knowing that they can finance themselves without the assistance of the Federal Government.	Stating the Court's reasoning
opinion-G16-(United States v. Mississippi Chemical	It is perhaps debatable whether these attributes should properly be valued at $100 per share, but we are not called upon merely to resolve a question of valuation.	Determining jurisdiction
opinion-G16-(United States v. Mississippi Chemical	Rather, we must decide whether it is artificial to characterize these unique expenditures as payments for a capital asset.	Stating the issue(s) to be decided
opinion-G16-(United States v. Mississippi Chemical	We find that it is not.	Giving the holding/ruling of the Court
opinion-G16-(United States v. Mississippi Chemical	The taxpayers and the Government each allege that the other is looking at form rather than substance.	Stating the Court's reasoning
opinion-G16-(United States v. Mississippi Chemical	At some point, however, the form in which a transaction is cast must have considerable impact.	Stating the Court's reasoning

Baldwin_v_Reese_retagged	"We granted certiorari to determine whether the Ninth Circuit has correctly interpreted the ""fair presentation"" requirement."	Granting certiorari
Baldwin_v_Reese_retagged	We begin by assuming that Reese's petition by itself did not properly alert the Oregon Supreme Court to the federal nature of Reese's claim.	Stating the Court's reasoning
Baldwin_v_Reese_retagged	"On that assumption, Reese failed *31 to meet the ""fair presentation"" standard, and the Ninth Circuit was wrong to hold the contrary."	Rejecting arguments/a reasoning
Baldwin_v_Reese_retagged	"We recognize that the justices of the Oregon Supreme Court did have an ""opportunity"" to read the lower court opinions in Reese's case."	Stating the Court's reasoning
Baldwin_v_Reese_retagged	That opportunity means that the judges could have read them.	Stating the Court's reasoning
Baldwin_v_Reese_retagged	"But to say that a petitioner ""fairly presents"" a federal claim when an appellate judge can discover that claim only by reading lower court opinions in the case is to say that those judges must read the lower court opinions  for otherwise they would forfeit the State's opportunity to decide that federal claim in the first instance."	Stating the Court's reasoning
Baldwin_v_Reese_retagged	In our view, federal habeas corpus law does not impose such a requirement.	Rejecting arguments/a reasoning
Baldwin_v_Reese_retagged	For one thing, the requirement would force state appellate judges to alter their ordinary review practices.	Stating the Court's reasoning
Baldwin_v_Reese_retagged	Appellate judges, of course, will often read lower court opinions, but they do not necessarily do so in every case.	Referring to unwritten sources of authority
Baldwin_v_Reese_retagged	Sometimes an appellate court can decide a legal question on the basis of the briefs alone.	Referring to unwritten sources of authority
Baldwin_v_Reese_retagged	That is particularly so where the question at issue is whether to exercise a discretionary power of review, i. e., whether to review the merits of a lower court decision.	Referring to unwritten sources of authority
Baldwin_v_Reese_retagged	In such instances, the nature of the issue may matter more than does the legal validity of the lower court decision.	Referring to unwritten sources of authority
Baldwin_v_Reese_retagged	And the nature of the issue alone may lead the court to decide not to hear the case.	Referring to unwritten sources of authority
Baldwin_v_Reese_retagged	Indeed, the Oregon Supreme Court is a court with a discretionary power of review.	Describing primary sources (other than SCOTUS decisions)
Baldwin_v_Reese_retagged	"And Oregon Rule of Appellate Procedure 9.05(7) (2003) instructs litigants seeking discretionary review to identify clearly in the petition itself the legal questions presented, why those questions have special importance, a short statement of relevant facts, and the reasons for reversal, ""including appropriate authorities."""	Describing primary sources (other than SCOTUS decisions)
Baldwin_v_Reese_retagged	For another thing, the opinion-reading requirement would impose a serious burden upon judges of state appellate courts, particularly those with discretionary review powers.	Stating the Court's reasoning
Baldwin_v_Reese_retagged	Those courts have heavy workloads, which would be significantly *32 increased if their judges had to read through lower court opinions or briefs in every instance.	Describing secondary sources
Baldwin_v_Reese_retagged	See National Center for State Courts, State Court Caseload Statistics 2002, pp. 106-110 (Table 2)	Citing secondary sources
Baldwin_v_Reese_retagged	Finally, we do not find such a requirement necessary to avoid imposing unreasonable procedural burdens upon state prisoners who may eventually seek habeas corpus.	Stating the Court's reasoning
Baldwin_v_Reese_retagged	"A litigant wishing to raise a federal issue can easily indicate the federal law basis for his claim in a state-court petition or brief, for example, by citing in conjunction with the claim the federal source of law on which he relies or a case deciding such a claim on federal grounds, or by simply labeling the claim ""federal."""	Referring to unwritten sources of authority
Baldwin_v_Reese_retagged	For these reasons, we believe that the requirement imposed by the Ninth Circuit would unjustifiably undercut the considerations of federal-state comity that the exhaustion requirement seeks to promote.	Stating the Court's reasoning
Baldwin_v_Reese_retagged	"We consequently hold that ordinarily a state prisoner does not ""fairly present"" a claim to a state court if that court must read beyond a petition or a brief (or a similar document) that does not alert it to the presence of a federal claim in order to find material, such as a lower court opinion in the case, that does so."

Baldwin_v_Reese_retagged	"Reese must concede that his petition does not explicitly say that the words ""ineffective assistance of appellate counsel"" refer to a federal claim."	Stating the Court's reasoning
Baldwin_v_Reese_retagged	The petition refers to provisions of the Federal Constitution in respect to other claims but not in respect to this one.	Recalling a secondary source
Baldwin_v_Reese_retagged	The petition provides no citation of any case that might have alerted the court to the alleged federal nature of the claim.	Recalling a secondary source

Baldwin_v_Reese_retagged	"Reese asserts that the petition nonetheless ""fairly presents"" a federal ""ineffective assistance of appellate counsel"" claim for two reasons."	Recalling an argument from the respondent
Baldwin_v_Reese_retagged	"First, he says that the word ""ineffective"" is a term of art in Oregon that refers only to federal-law claims and not to similar state-law claims, which, he adds, in Oregon are solely referred to as ""inadequate assistance"" claims."

Baldwin_v_Reese_retagged	"And thus the Oregon Supreme Court should have known, from his use of the word ""ineffective,"" that his claim was federal."	Recalling an argument from the respondent

California v. Greenwood_retagged	*37 JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.	Announcing function
California v. Greenwood_retagged	The issue here is whether the Fourth Amendment prohibits the warrantless search and seizure of garbage left for collection outside the curtilage of a home.	Stating the issue(s) to be decided
California v. Greenwood_retagged	We conclude, in accordance with the vast majority of lower courts that have addressed the issue, that it does not.	Giving the holding/ruling of the Court
California v. Greenwood_retagged	In early 1984, Investigator Jenny Stracner of the Laguna Beach Police Department received information indicating that respondent Greenwood might be engaged in narcotics trafficking.	Describing the adjudicated facts
California v. Greenwood_retagged	Stracner learned that a criminal suspect had informed a federal drug enforcement agent in February 1984 that a truck filled with illegal drugs was en route to the Laguna Beach address at which Greenwood resided.	Describing the adjudicated facts
California v. Greenwood_retagged	In addition, a neighbor complained of heavy vehicular traffic late at night in front of Greenwood's single-family home.	Describing the adjudicated facts
California v. Greenwood_retagged	The neighbor reported that the vehicles remained at Greenwood's house for only a few minutes.	Describing the adjudicated facts
California v. Greenwood_retagged	Stracner sought to investigate this information by conducting a surveillance of Greenwood's home.	Describing the adjudicated facts
California v. Greenwood_retagged	She observed several vehicles make brief stops at the house during the late-night and early morning hours, and she followed a truck from the house to a residence that had previously been under investigation as a narcotics-trafficking location.	Describing the adjudicated facts
California v. Greenwood_retagged	On April 6, 1984, Stracner asked the neighborhood's regular trash collector to pick up the plastic garbage bags that Greenwood had left on the curb in front of his house and to turn the bags over to her without mixing their contents with garbage from other houses.	Describing the adjudicated facts
California v. Greenwood_retagged	The trash collector cleaned his truck bin of other refuse, collected the garbage bags from the street in front of Greenwood's house, and turned the bags over to Stracner.	Describing the adjudicated facts
California v. Greenwood_retagged	The officer searched through the rubbish *38 and found items indicative of narcotics use.	Describing the adjudicated facts
California v. Greenwood_retagged	She recited the information that she had gleaned from the trash search in an affidavit in support of a warrant to search Greenwood's home.	Describing procedural events
California v. Greenwood_retagged	Police officers encountered both respondents at the house later that day when they arrived to execute the warrant.	Describing the adjudicated facts
California v. Greenwood_retagged	The police discovered quantities of cocaine and hashish during their search of the house.	Describing the adjudicated facts
California v. Greenwood_retagged	Respondents were arrested on felony narcotics charges.	Describing procedural events
California v. Greenwood_retagged	They subsequently posted bail.	Describing procedural events
California v. Greenwood_retagged	The police continued to receive reports of many late-night visitors to the Greenwood house.	Describing the adjudicated facts
California v. Greenwood_retagged	On May 4, Investigator Robert Rahaeuser obtained Greenwood's garbage from the regular trash collector in the same manner as had Stracner.	Describing the adjudicated facts
California v. Greenwood_retagged	The garbage again contained evidence of narcotics use.	Describing the adjudicated facts
California v. Greenwood_retagged	Rahaeuser secured another search warrant for Greenwood's home based on the information from the second trash search.	Describing procedural events
California v. Greenwood_retagged	The police found more narcotics and evidence of narcotics trafficking when they executed the warrant.	Describing the adjudicated facts
California v. Greenwood_retagged	Greenwood was again arrested.	Describing procedural events
California v. Greenwood_retagged	The Superior Court dismissed the charges against respondents on the authority of People v. Krivda, 5 Cal. 3d 357 , 486 P.2d 1262 (1971), which held that warrantless trash searches violate the Fourth Amendment and the California Constitution.	Giving the holding/ruling of a lower court
California v. Greenwood_retagged	The court found that the police would not have had probable cause to search the Greenwood home without the evidence obtained from the trash searches.	Giving the holding/ruling of a lower court
California v. Greenwood_retagged	The Court of Appeal affirmed.	Giving the holding/ruling of a lower court
California v. Greenwood_retagged	182 Cal. App. 3d 729, 227 Cal. Rptr. 539 (1986).	Citing secondary sources
California v. Greenwood_retagged	The court noted at the outset that the fruits of warrantless trash searches could no longer be suppressed if Krivda were based only on the California Constitution, because since 1982 the State has barred the suppression of evidence seized in violation of California law but not federal law.

California v. Greenwood_retagged	Respondents do not disagree with this standard.	Describing the legal arguments made in the present case
California v. Greenwood_retagged	They assert, however, that they had, and exhibited, an expectation of privacy with respect to the trash that was searched by the police:	Recalling an argument from the respondent
California v. Greenwood_retagged	The trash, which was placed on the street for collection at a fixed time, was contained in opaque plastic bags, which the garbage collector was expected to pick up, mingle with the trash of others, and deposit at the garbage dump.	Recalling an argument from the respondent
California v. Greenwood_retagged	The trash was only temporarily on the street, and there was little likelihood that it would be inspected by anyone.	Recalling an argument from the respondent
California v. Greenwood_retagged	It may well be that respondents did not expect that the contents of their garbage bags would become known to the police or other members of the public.	Stating the Court's reasoning
California v. Greenwood_retagged	An expectation of privacy does not give rise to Fourth Amendment protection, *40 however, unless society is prepared to accept that expectation as objectively reasonable.	Rejecting arguments/a reasoning
California v. Greenwood_retagged	Here, we conclude that respondents exposed their garbage to the public sufficiently to defeat their claim to Fourth Amendment protection.	Stating the Court's reasoning
California v. Greenwood_retagged	It is common knowledge that plastic garbage bags left on or at the side of a public street are readily accessible to animals, [2] children, scavengers, [3] snoops, [4] and other members of the public.	Recalling a SCOTUS decision
California v. Greenwood_retagged	See Krivda, supra , at 367, 486 P.2d, at 1269 .	Citing a SCOTUS decision
California v. Greenwood_retagged	Moreover, respondents placed their refuse at the curb for the express purpose of conveying it to a third party, the trash collector, who might himself have sorted through respondents' trash or permitted others, such as the police, to do so.	Stating the Court's reasoning
California v. Greenwood_retagged	"Accordingly, having deposited their garbage ""in an area particularly suited for *41 public inspection and, in a manner of speaking, public consumption, for the express purpose of having strangers take it,"" United States v. Reicherter, 647 F.2d 397 , 399 (CA3 1981), respondents could have had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the inculpatory items that they discarded."	Stating the Court's reasoning
California v. Greenwood_retagged	Furthermore, as we have held, the police cannot reasonably be expected to avert their eyes from evidence of criminal activity that could have been observed by any member of the public.	Stating the Court's reasoning
California v. Greenwood_retagged	"Hence, ""[w]hat a person knowingly exposes to the public, even in his own home or office, is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection."""	Quoting a SCOTUS decision
California v. Greenwood_retagged	Katz v. United States, supra, at 351.	Citing a SCOTUS decision
California v. Greenwood_retagged	We held in Smith v. Maryland, 442 U.S. 735 (1979), for example, that the police did not violate the Fourth Amendment by causing a pen register to be installed at the telephone company's offices to record the telephone numbers dialed by a criminal suspect.	Recalling a SCOTUS decision
California v. Greenwood_retagged	An individual has no legitimate expectation of privacy in the numbers dialed on his telephone, we reasoned, because he voluntarily conveys those numbers to the telephone company when he uses the telephone.	Recalling a SCOTUS decision

California v. Greenwood_retagged	Id., at 743-744.	Citing a SCOTUS decision
California v. Greenwood_retagged	Similarly, we held in California v. Ciraolo, supra , that the police were not required by the Fourth Amendment to obtain a warrant before conducting surveillance of the respondent's fenced backyard from a private plane flying at an altitude of 1,000 feet.	Recalling a SCOTUS decision
California v. Greenwood_retagged	"We concluded that the respondent's expectation that his yard was protected from such surveillance was unreasonable because ""[a]ny member of the public flying in this airspace who glanced down could have seen everything that these officers observed."""	Recalling a SCOTUS decision
California v. Greenwood_retagged	Id., at 213-214.	Citing a SCOTUS decision
California v. Greenwood_retagged	Our conclusion that society would not accept as reasonable respondents' claim to an expectation of privacy in trash left for collection in an area accessible to the public is reinforced by the unanimous rejection of similar claims by the Federal Courts of Appeals.

California v. Greenwood_retagged	We reject respondent Greenwood's alternative argument for affirmance: that his expectation of privacy in his garbage should be deemed reasonable as a matter of federal constitutional law because the warrantless search and seizure of his garbage was impermissible as a matter of California law.	Rejecting arguments/a reasoning
California v. Greenwood_retagged	He urges that the state-law right of Californians to privacy in their garbage, announced by the California Supreme Court in Krivda, supra , survived the subsequent state constitutional amendment eliminating the suppression remedy as a means of enforcing that right.	Recalling an argument from the respondent

California v. Greenwood_retagged	Hence, he argues that the Fourth Amendment should itself vindicate that right.	Recalling an argument from the respondent
California v. Greenwood_retagged	Individual States may surely construe their own constitutions as imposing more stringent constraints on police conduct than does the Federal Constitution.	Referring to unwritten sources of authority
California v. Greenwood_retagged	We have never intimated, however, that whether or not a search is reasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment depends on the law of the particular State in which the search occurs.	Rejecting arguments/a reasoning

California v. Greenwood_retagged	We do not accept this submission.	Rejecting arguments/a reasoning
California v. Greenwood_retagged	Greenwood finally urges as an additional ground for affirmance that the California constitutional amendment eliminating the exclusionary rule for evidence seized in violation of state but not federal law violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

California v. Greenwood_retagged	California could amend its Constitution to negate the holding in Krivda that state law forbids warrantless searches of trash.	Referring to unwritten sources of authority
California v. Greenwood_retagged	We are convinced that the State may likewise eliminate the exclusionary rule as a remedy for violations of that right.	Stating the Court's reasoning

California v. Greenwood_retagged	"We *45 have declined to apply the exclusionary rule indiscriminately ""when law enforcement officers have acted in objective good faith or their transgressions have been minor,"" because ""the magnitude of the benefit conferred on . . . guilty defendants [in such circumstances] offends basic concepts of the criminal justice system."""

California v. Greenwood_retagged	The States are not foreclosed by the Due Process Clause from using a similar balancing approach to delineate the scope of their own exclusionary rules.	Referring to unwritten sources of authority
California v. Greenwood_retagged	Hence, the people of California could permissibly conclude that the benefits of excluding relevant evidence of criminal activity do not outweigh the costs when the police conduct at issue does not violate federal law.	Stating the Court's reasoning

Commissioner v. Groetzinger_MCL_retagged	He did not itemize deductions.	Describing the adjudicated facts
Commissioner v. Groetzinger_MCL_retagged	Instead, he computed his tax liability from the tax tables.	Describing the adjudicated facts
Commissioner v. Groetzinger_MCL_retagged	Upon audit, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined that respondent's $70,000 in gambling winnings were to be included in his gross income and that, pursuant to § 165(d) of the Code, 26 U.S. C. § 165(d), a deduction was to be allowed for his gambling losses to the extent of these gambling gains.	Describing the adjudicated facts
Commissioner v. Groetzinger_MCL_retagged	But the Commissioner further determined that, under the law as it was in 1978, a portion of respondent's $70,000 gambling-loss deduction was an item of tax preference and operated to subject him to the minimum tax under § 56(a) of the Code, 26 U.S. C. § 56(a) (1976 ed.).

Commissioner v.

Commissioner v. Groetzinger_MCL_retagged	These determinations by the Commissioner produced a § 56(a) minimum tax of $2,142 and, with certain other adjustments not now in dispute, resulted in a total asserted tax deficiency of $2,522 for respondent for 1978.	Describing the adjudicated facts

Commissioner v.

Commissioner v. Groetzinger_MCL_retagged	Justice Brandeis, in his opinion for the Court, noted that the Board of Tax Appeals theretofore had ruled that a taxpayer who devoted the major portion of his time to transactions on the stock exchange for the purpose of making a livelihood could treat losses incurred as having been sustained in the course of a trade or business.

Commissioner v. Groetzinger_MCL_retagged	Be that as it may, this taxpayer's case must be decided and, from what we have outlined above, must be decided in the face of a decisional history that is not positive or even fairly indicative, as we read the cases, of what the result should be.	Stating the Court's reasoning
Commissioner v. Groetzinger_MCL_retagged	There are, however, some helpful indicators.	Announcing function
Commissioner v. Groetzinger_MCL_retagged	If a taxpayer, as Groetzinger is stipulated to have done in 1978, devotes his full-time activity to gambling, and it is his intended livelihood source, it would seem that basic concepts of fairness (if there be much of that in the income tax law) demand that his activity be regarded as a trade or business just as any other readily accepted activity, such as being a retail store proprietor or, to come closer categorically, as being a casino operator or as being an active trader on the exchanges.	Recalling a fact or procedural event
Commissioner v. Groetzinger_MCL_retagged	It is argued, however, that a full-time gambler is not offering goods or his services, within the line of demarcation that Justice Frankfurter would have drawn in Du Pont.	Recalling an argument from the petitioner
Commissioner v. Groetzinger_MCL_retagged	Respondent replies that he indeed is supplying goods and services, not only to himself but, as well, to the gambling market; thus, he says, he comes within the Frankfurter test even if that were to be imposed as the proper measure.

Commissioner v.

Recalling an argument from the petitioner
Commissioner v. Groetzinger_MCL_retagged	We would defer, instead, to the Code's normal focus on what we regard as a common-sense concept of what is a trade or business.	Stating the Court's reasoning
Commissioner v. Groetzinger_MCL_retagged	Otherwise, as here, in the context of a minimum tax, it is not too extreme to say that the taxpayer is being taxed on his gambling losses, [15] a result distinctly out of line with the Code's focus on income.	Stating the Court's reasoning
Commissioner v. Groetzinger_MCL_retagged	We do not overrule or cut back on the Court's holding in Higgins when we conclude that if one's gambling activity is pursued full time, in good faith, and with regularity, to the production of income for a livelihood, and is not a mere hobby, it is a trade or business within the meaning of the statutes with which we are here concerned.

Giving the context
opinion-G16-(Florida Power _ Light Co. v.

opinion-G16-(Florida Power _ Light Co. v. Electric	We may assume without deciding that the Board's Oakland Mailers decision fell within the outer limits of this test, but its decisions in the present cases clearly do not.	Stating the Court's reasoning
opinion-G16-(Florida Power _ Light Co. v. Electric	For it is certain that these supervisors were not engaged in collective bargaining or grievance adjustment, or in any activities related thereto, when they crossed union picket lines during an economic strike to engage in rank-and-file struck work. [16]	Stating the Court's reasoning
opinion-G16-(Florida Power _ Light Co. v. Electric	It is strenuously asserted, however, that to permit a union to discipline supervisor-members for performing *806 rank-and-file work during an economic strike will deprive the employer of the full loyalty of those supervisors.	Recalling an argument from the petitioner
opinion-G16-(Florida Power _ Light Co. v. Electric	"Indeed, it is precisely that concern that is reflected in these and other recent decisions of the Board holding that the statutory language ""restrain or coerce . . . an employer in the selection of his representatives for the purposes of collective bargaining or the adjustment of grievances"" is not confined to situations in which the union's object is to force a change in the identity of the employer's representatives, but may properly be read to encompass any situation in which the union's actions are likely to deprive the employer of the undivided loyalty of his supervisory employees."

opinion-G16-(Florida Power _ Light Co. v. Electric	As the Board stated in Wisconsin Electric:	Announcing function
opinion-G16-(Florida Power _ Light Co. v. Electric	"During the strike of the Union, the Employer clearly considered its supervisors among those it could depend on during this period. The Union's fining of the supervisors who were acting in the Employer's interest in performing the struck work severely jeopardized the relationship between the Employer and its supervisors. Thus, the fines, if found to be lawful, would now permit the Union to drive a wedge between a supervisor and the Employer, thus interfering with the performance of the duties the Employer had a right to expect the supervisor to perform. The Employer could no longer count on the complete and undivided loyalty of those it had selected to act as its collective-bargaining agents or to act for it in adjusting grievances. Moreover, such fines clearly interfere with the Employer's control over its own representatives. ""The purpose of Section 8 (b) (1) (B) is to assure to the employer that its selected collective-bargaining representatives will be completely faithful to its desires. This cannot be achieved if the union has an *807 effective method, union disciplinary action, by which it can pressure such representatives to deviate from the interests of the employer."

Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL	Supra, at 504.	Citing a SCOTUS decision
Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL	Of course the right of an accused to fundamental fairness in the jury selection process is a compelling interest.	Stating the Court's reasoning
Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL	But the California court's conclusion that Sixth Amendment and privacy interests were sufficient to warrant prolonged closure was unsupported by findings *511 showing that an open proceeding in fact threatened those interests; [10]	Stating the Court's reasoning
Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL	hence it is not possible to conclude that closure was warranted. [11]	Stating the Court's reasoning

Stating the Court's reasoning
Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL	The privacy interests of such a prospective juror must be balanced against the historic values we have discussed and the need for openness of the process.	Stating the Court's reasoning
Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL	To preserve fairness and at the same time protect legitimate privacy, a trial judge must at all times maintain control of the process of jury selection and should inform the array of prospective jurors, once the general nature of sensitive questions is made known to them, that those individuals believing public questioning will prove damaging because of embarrassment, may properly request an opportunity to present the problem to the judge in camera but with counsel present and on the record.	Stating the Court's reasoning
Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL	By requiring the prospective juror to make an affirmative request, the trial judge can ensure that there is in fact a valid basis for a belief that disclosure infringes a significant interest in privacy.	Stating the Court's reasoning
Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL	This process will minimize the risk of unnecessary closure.	Stating the Court's reasoning
Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL	The exercise of sound discretion by the court may lead to excusing such a person from jury service.	Stating the Court's reasoning
Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL	When limited closure is ordered, the constitutional values sought to be protected by holding open proceedings may be satisfied later by making a transcript of the closed proceedings available within a reasonable time, if the judge determines that disclosure can be accomplished while safeguarding the juror's valid privacy interests.	Stating the Court's reasoning
Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL	Even then a valid privacy right may rise to a level that part of the transcript should be sealed, or the name of a juror withheld, to protect the person from embarrassment.	Stating the Court's reasoning
Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL	*513 The judge at this trial closed an incredible six weeks of voir dire without considering alternatives to closure.	Recalling a fact or procedural event
Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL	"Later the court declined to release a transcript of the voir dire even while stating that ""most of the information"" in the transcript was ""dull and boring."""	Recalling a fact or procedural event
Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL	Supra, at 504.	Citing secondary sources
Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL	Those parts of the transcript reasonably entitled to privacy could have been sealed without such a sweeping order;	Stating the Court's reasoning
Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL	a trial judge should explain why the material is entitled to privacy.	Stating the Court's reasoning
Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL	Assuming that some jurors had protectible privacy interests in some of their answers, the trial judge provided no explanation as to why his broad order denying access to information at the voir dire was not limited to information that was actually sensitive and deserving of privacy protection.	Stating the Court's reasoning
Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL	Nor did he consider whether he could disclose the substance of the sensitive answers while preserving the anonymity of the jurors involved.	Stating the Court's reasoning
Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL	Thus not only was there a failure to articulate findings with the requisite specificity but there was also a failure to consider alternatives to closure and to total suppression of the transcript.	Stating the Court's reasoning
Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL	The trial judge should seal only such parts of the transcript as necessary to preserve the anonymity of the individuals sought to be protected.	Giving the holding/ruling of the Court
Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL	The judgment of the Court of Appeal is vacated, and the case is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.	Giving the holding/ruling of the Court
Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL	It is so ordered.	Giving the holding/ruling of the Court

Recalling an argument from the respondent
opinion-G16-(Return Mail, Inc. v. Postal Service,	But, as already explained, the Government’s ability to obtain a patent under §207(a)(1) does not speak to whether Congress meant for the Government to participate as a third-party challenger in AIA review proceedings.	Rejecting arguments/a reasoning

opinion-G16-(Return Mail, Inc. v.
