Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL,"I agree with much of what defense counsel and People's counsel have said and I also, regardless of the public's right to know, I also feel that's rather difficult that by a person performing their civic duty as a prospective juror putting their private information as open to the public which I just think there is certain areas that the right of privacy should prevail and a right to a fair trial should prevail and the right of the people to know, I think, should have some limitations and, so, at this stage, the motion to open up . . . the individual sequestered voir dire proceedings is denied without prejudice.",Quoting secondary sources

Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL,"For present purposes, how we allocate the ""right"" to openness as between the accused and the public, or whether we view it as a component inherent in the system benefiting both, is not crucial.",Stating the Court's reasoning
Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL,No right ranks higher than the right of the accused to a fair trial.,Referring to unwritten sources of authority

Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL,The open trial thus plays as important a role in the administration of justice today as it did for centuries before our separation from England.,Referring to unwritten sources of authority
Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL,The value of openness lies in the fact that people not actually attending trials can have confidence that standards of fairness are being observed;,Referring to unwritten sources of authority
Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL,the sure knowledge that anyone is free to attend gives assurance that established procedures are being followed and that deviations will become known.,Referring to unwritten sources of authority

Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL,"When the public is aware that the law is being enforced and the criminal justice system is functioning, an outlet is provided for these understandable reactions and emotions.",Referring to unwritten sources of authority

Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL,"Id., at 606-607.",Citing a SCOTUS decision
Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL,The presumption of openness may be overcome only by an overriding interest based on findings that closure is essential to preserve higher values and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.,Referring to unwritten sources of authority
Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL,The interest is to be articulated along with findings specific enough that a reviewing court can determine whether the closure order was properly entered.,Referring to unwritten sources of authority
Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL,We now turn to whether the presumption of openness has been rebutted in this case.,Announcing function
Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL,"Although three days of voir dire in this case were open to the public, six weeks of the proceedings were closed, and media requests for the transcript were denied. [9]",Recalling a fact or procedural event
Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL,"The Superior Court asserted two interests in support of its closure order and orders denying a transcript: the right of the defendant to a fair trial, and the right to privacy of the prospective jurors, for any whose ""special experiences in sensitive areas . . . do not appear to be appropriate for public discussion.""",Describing the legal arguments made in the present case
Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL,"Supra, at 504.",Citing a SCOTUS decision
Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL,Of course the right of an accused to fundamental fairness in the jury selection process is a compelling interest.,Stating the Court's reasoning
Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL,But the California court's conclusion that Sixth Amendment and privacy interests were sufficient to warrant prolonged closure was unsupported by findings *511 showing that an open proceeding in fact threatened those interests; [10],Stating the Court's reasoning
Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL,hence it is not possible to conclude that closure was warranted. [11],Stating the Court's reasoning
Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL,"Even with findings adequate to support closure, the trial court's orders denying access to voir dire testimony failed to consider whether alternatives were available to protect the interests of the prospective jurors that the trial court's orders sought to guard.",Stating the Court's reasoning
Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL,"Absent consideration of alternatives to closure, the trial court could not constitutionally close the voir dire.",Rejecting arguments/a reasoning
Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL,"The jury selection process may, in some circumstances, give rise to a compelling interest of a prospective juror when interrogation touches on deeply personal matters that person has legitimate reasons for keeping out of the public domain.",Referring to unwritten sources of authority
Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL,*512 The trial involved testimony concerning an alleged rape of a teenage girl.,Recalling a fact or procedural event
Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL,Some questions may have been appropriate to prospective jurors that would give rise to legitimate privacy interests of those persons.,Referring to unwritten sources of authority
Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL,"For example a prospective juror might privately inform the judge that she, or a member of her family, had been raped but had declined to seek prosecution because of the embarrassment and emotional trauma from the very disclosure of the episode.",Stating the Court's reasoning
Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL,The privacy interests of such a prospective juror must be balanced against the historic values we have discussed and the need for openness of the process.,Stating the Court's reasoning
Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL,"To preserve fairness and at the same time protect legitimate privacy, a trial judge must at all times maintain control of the process of jury selection and should inform the array of prospective jurors, once the general nature of sensitive questions is made known to them, that those individuals believing public questioning will prove damaging because of embarrassment, may properly request an opportunity to present the problem to the judge in camera but with counsel present and on the record.",Stating the Court's reasoning
Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL,"By requiring the prospective juror to make an affirmative request, the trial judge can ensure that there is in fact a valid basis for a belief that disclosure infringes a significant interest in privacy.",Stating the Court's reasoning
Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL,This process will minimize the risk of unnecessary closure.,Stating the Court's reasoning
Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL,The exercise of sound discretion by the court may lead to excusing such a person from jury service.,Stating the Court's reasoning
Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL,"When limited closure is ordered, the constitutional values sought to be protected by holding open proceedings may be satisfied later by making a transcript of the closed proceedings available within a reasonable time, if the judge determines that disclosure can be accomplished while safeguarding the juror's valid privacy interests.",Stating the Court's reasoning
Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL,"Even then a valid privacy right may rise to a level that part of the transcript should be sealed, or the name of a juror withheld, to protect the person from embarrassment.",Stating the Court's reasoning
Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL,*513 The judge at this trial closed an incredible six weeks of voir dire without considering alternatives to closure.,Recalling a fact or procedural event
Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL,"Later the court declined to release a transcript of the voir dire even while stating that ""most of the information"" in the transcript was ""dull and boring.""",Recalling a fact or procedural event
Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL,"Supra, at 504.",Citing secondary sources
Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL,Those parts of the transcript reasonably entitled to privacy could have been sealed without such a sweeping order;,Stating the Court's reasoning
Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL,a trial judge should explain why the material is entitled to privacy.,Stating the Court's reasoning
Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL,"Assuming that some jurors had protectible privacy interests in some of their answers, the trial judge provided no explanation as to why his broad order denying access to information at the voir dire was not limited to information that was actually sensitive and deserving of privacy protection.",Stating the Court's reasoning
Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL,Nor did he consider whether he could disclose the substance of the sensitive answers while preserving the anonymity of the jurors involved.,Stating the Court's reasoning
Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL,Thus not only was there a failure to articulate findings with the requisite specificity but there was also a failure to consider alternatives to closure and to total suppression of the transcript.,Stating the Court's reasoning
Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL,The trial judge should seal only such parts of the transcript as necessary to preserve the anonymity of the individuals sought to be protected.,Giving the holding/ruling of the Court
Press Enterprise v Sup. Court_retagged_MCL,"The judgment of the Court of Appeal is vacated, and the case is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.",Giving the holding/ruling of the Court
