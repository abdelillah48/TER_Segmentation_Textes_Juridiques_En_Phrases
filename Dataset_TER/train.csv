ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"During the 1950's, a public controversy developed over the way respondent and the Commissioners operated the Area; some protested that respondent and the Commissioners had not developed the *78 Area's full potential, either as a resort for local residents or as a tourist attraction that might contribute to the county's taxes.",Describing the adjudicated facts

ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"In relevant part, it reads:",Announcing function
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"Been doing a little listening and checking at Belknap Recreation Area and am thunderstruck by what am learning. ""This year, a year without snow till very late, a year with actually few very major changes in procedure; the difference in cash income simply fantastic, almost unbelievable. ""On any sort of comparative basis, the Area this year is doing literally hundreds of per cent BETTER than last year. ""When consider that last year was excellent snow year, that season started because of more snow, months earlier last year, one can only ponder following question: ""What happened to all the money last year? and every other year? What magic has Dana Beane *79 [Chairman of the new commission] and rest of commission, and Mr. Warner [respondent's replacement as Supervisor] wrought to make such tremendous difference in net cash results?",Quoting secondary sources
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,The column on its face contains no clearly actionable statement.,Stating the Court's reasoning
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"Although the questions ""What happened to all the money last year? and every other year?"" could be read to imply peculation, they could also be read, in context, merely to praise the present administration.",Stating the Court's reasoning

ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"no reference is made to respondent, the three elected commissioners, or anyone else who had a part in the administration of the Area during respondent's tenure",Recalling a fact or procedural event
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"Persons familiar with the controversy over the Area might well read it as complimenting the luck or skill of the new management in attracting increased patronage and producing a ""tremendous difference in net cash results"" despite less favorable snow; indeed, witnesses for petitioner testified that they so read the column.",Stating the Court's reasoning
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"indeed, witnesses for petitioner testified that they so read the column.",Describing the adjudicated facts
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,Respondent offered extrinsic proofs to supply a defamatory meaning.,Describing procedural events
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"These proofs were that the column greatly exaggerated any improvement under the new regime, and that a large part of the community understood it to say that the asserted improvements were not explicable by anything the new management had done.",Describing procedural events
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"Rather, his witnesses testified, they read the column as imputing mismanagement and peculation during respondent's tenure.",Describing the adjudicated facts
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,Respondent urged two theories to support a recovery based on that imputation.,Describing procedural events
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"The first was that the jury could award him damages if it found that the column cast suspicion indiscriminately *80 on the small number of persons who composed the former management group, whether or not it found that the imputation of misconduct was specifically made of and concerning him. [2]",Recalling an argument from the respondent
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"This theory of recovery was open to respondent under New Hampshire law; the trial judge explicitly instructed the jury that ""an imputation of impropriety or a crime to one or some of a small group that casts suspicion upon all is actionable."" [3]",Describing primary sources (other than SCOTUS decisions)
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"The question is presented, however, whether that theory of recovery is precluded by our holding in New York Times that, in the absence of sufficient evidence that the attack focused on the plaintiff, an otherwise impersonal attack on governmental operations cannot be utilized to establish a libel of those administering the operations.",Recalling a SCOTUS decision
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"376 U. S., at 290-292 .",Citing a SCOTUS decision
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"The plaintiff in New York Times was one of the three elected Commissioners of the City of Montgomery, Alabama.",Giving the facts of another case
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,His duties included the supervision of the police department.,Giving the facts of another case
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"The statements in the advertisement upon which he principally relied as referring to him were that ""truckloads of police . . . ringed the Alabama State College Campus"" after a demonstration on the State Capitol steps, and that Dr. Martin Luther King had been ""arrested . . . seven times.""",Giving the facts of another case
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"These statements were false in that although the police had been ""deployed near the campus,"" they had not actually ""ringed"" it and had not gone there in connection with a State Capitol demonstration, and in that Dr. King had been arrested only *81 four times.",Giving the facts of another case
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"We held that evidence that Sullivan as Police Commissioner was the supervisory head of the Police Department was constitutionally insufficient to show that the statements about police activity were ""of and concerning"" him; we rejected as inconsistent with the First and Fourteenth Amendments the proposition followed by the Alabama Supreme Court in the case that ""[i]n measuring the performance or deficiencies of . . . groups, praise or criticism is usually attached to the official in complete control of the body,""",Recalling a SCOTUS decision
ROSENBLATT v.

ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"To allow the jury to connect the statements with Sullivan on that presumption alone was, in our view, to invite the spectre of prosecutions for libel on government, which the Constitution does not tolerate in any form.",Recalling a SCOTUS decision

ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"We held ""that such a proposition may not constitutionally be utilized to establish that an otherwise impersonal attack on governmental operations was a libel of an official responsible for those operations.""",Recalling a SCOTUS decision
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"376 U. S., at 292 .",Citing a SCOTUS decision
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,There must be evidence showing that the attack was read as specifically directed at the plaintiff.,Recalling a SCOTUS decision
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"Were the statement at issue in this case an explicit charge that the Commissioners and Baer or the entire Area management were corrupt, we assume without deciding that any member of the identified group might recover. [5]",Stating the Court's reasoning
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,The statement itself might be sufficient evidence that the attack was specifically directed at each individual.,Stating the Court's reasoning
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"Even if a charge and reference were merely implicit, as is alleged here, but a plaintiff could show by extrinsic proofs that the statement referred to him, it would be no defense to a suit by one member of an *82 identifiable group engaged in governmental activity that another was also attacked.",Stating the Court's reasoning
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"These situations are distinguishable from the present case; here, the jury was permitted to infer both defamatory content and reference from the challenged statement itself, although the statement on its face is only an impersonal discussion of government activity.",Stating the Court's reasoning
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"To the extent the trial judge authorized the jury to award respondent a recovery without regard to evidence that the asserted implication of the column was made specifically of and concerning him, we hold that the instruction was erroneous. [6]",Giving the holding/ruling of the Court
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"Here, no explicit charge of peculation was made; no assault on the previous management appears.",Recalling a fact or procedural event
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"The jury was permitted to award damages upon a finding merely that respondent was one of a small group acting for an organ of government, only some of whom were implicated, but all of whom were tinged with suspicion.",Recalling a fact or procedural event
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"In effect, this permitted the jury to find liability merely on the basis of his relationship to the government agency, the operations of which were the subject of discussion.",Recalling a fact or procedural event
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"It is plain that the elected Commissioners, also members of that group, *83 would have been barred from suit on this theory under New York Times.",Stating the Court's reasoning
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,They would be required to show specific reference.,Stating the Court's reasoning
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"Whether or not respondent was a public official, as a member of the group he bears the same burden. [7]",Stating the Court's reasoning
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"A theory that the column cast indiscriminate suspicion on the members of the group responsible for the conduct of this governmental operation is tantamount to a demand for recovery based on libel of government, and therefore is constitutionally insufficient.",Stating the Court's reasoning
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"Since the trial judge's instructions were erroneous in this respect, the judgment must be reversed.",Giving the holding/ruling of the Court
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"Respondent's second theory, supported by testimony of several witnesses, was that the column was read as referring specifically to him, as the ""man in charge"" at the Area, personally responsible for its financial affairs.",Recalling an argument from the respondent
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"Even accepting respondent's reading, the column manifestly discusses the conduct of operations of government. [8]",Recalling a fact or procedural event
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"The subject matter may have been only of local interest, but at least here, where publication was addressed primarily to the interested community, that fact is constitutionally irrelevant.",Stating the Court's reasoning
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"The question is squarely presented whether the ""public official"" designation under New York Times applies.",Recalling a SCOTUS decision
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"If it does, it is clear that the jury instructions were improper.",Stating the Court's reasoning
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"Under the instructions, the jury was permitted *84 to find that negligent misstatement of fact would defeat petitioner's privilege.",Recalling a fact or procedural event
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"That test was rejected in Garrison, 379 U. S., at 79 , where we said, ""The test which we laid down in New York Times is not keyed to ordinary care; defeasance of the privilege is conditioned, not on mere negligence, but on reckless disregard for the truth.""",Recalling a SCOTUS decision
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"The trial court also charged that ""[d]efamatory matter which constitutes comment rather than fact is justified if made without malice and represented fair comment on matters of public interest,"" and defined malice to include ""ill will, evil motive, intention to injure . . . .""",Recalling a fact or procedural event
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"This definition of malice is constitutionally insufficient where discussion of public affairs is concerned; ""[w]e held in New York Times that a public official might be allowed the civil remedy only if he establishes that the utterance was false and that it was made with knowledge of its falsity or in reckless disregard of whether it was false or true.""",Rejecting arguments/a reasoning
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"Garrison, 379 U. S., at 74 .",Citing a SCOTUS decision
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"Turning, then, to the question whether respondent was a ""public official"" within New York Times, we reject at the outset his suggestion that it should be answered by reference to state-law standards.",Rejecting arguments/a reasoning
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"States have developed definitions of ""public official"" for local administrative purposes, not the purposes of a national constitutional protection. [9]",Referring to unwritten sources of authority
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"If existing state-law standards reflect the purposes of New York Times, this is at best accidental.",Stating the Court's reasoning
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"Our decision in New York Times, moreover, draws its force from the constitutional protections afforded free expression.",Recalling a SCOTUS decision
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"The standards that set the scope of its principles cannot therefore be such that ""the constitutional limits of free expression in the Nation would vary with state lines.""",Stating the Court's reasoning

ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"*85 We remarked in New York Times that we had no occasion ""to determine how far down into the lower ranks of government employees the `public official' designation would extend for purposes of this rule, or otherwise to specify categories of persons who would or would not be included.""",Recalling a SCOTUS decision

ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,No precise lines need be drawn for the purposes of this case.,Stating the Court's reasoning
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,The motivating force for the decision in New York Times was twofold.,Announcing function
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"We expressed ""a profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open, and that [such debate] may well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials.""",Recalling a SCOTUS decision
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"376 U. S., at 270 .",Citing a SCOTUS decision
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"There is, first, a strong interest in debate on public issues, and, second, a strong interest in debate about those persons who are in a position significantly to influence the resolution of those issues.",Stating the Court's reasoning
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,Criticism of government is at the very center of the constitutionally protected area of free discussion.,Stating the Court's reasoning
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"Criticism of those responsible for government operations must be free, lest criticism of government itself be penalized.",Stating the Court's reasoning
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"t is clear, therefore, that the ""public official"" designation applies at the very least to those among the hierarchy of government employees who have, or appear to the public to have, substantial responsibility for or control over the conduct of governmental affairs. [11]",Stating an intermediate conclusion
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,*86 This conclusion does not ignore the important social values which underlie the law of defamation.,Referring to unwritten sources of authority
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,Society has a pervasive and strong interest in preventing and redressing attacks upon reputation.,Referring to unwritten sources of authority
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"But in cases like the present, there is tension between this interest and the values nurtured by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.",Stating the Court's reasoning
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"The thrust of New York Times is that when interests in public discussion are particularly strong, as they were in that case, the Constitution limits the protections afforded by the law of defamation.",Recalling a SCOTUS decision
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"Where a position in government has such apparent importance that the public has an independent interest in the qualifications and performance of the person who holds it, beyond the general public interest in the qualifications and performance of all government employees, both elements we identified in New York Times are present [12] and the New York Times malice standards apply. [13]",Recalling a SCOTUS decision
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"*87 As respondent framed his case, he may have held such a position.",Stating the Court's reasoning
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"Since New York Times had not been decided when his case went to trial, his presentation was not shaped to the ""public official"" issue.",Recalling a fact or procedural event
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"He did, however, seek to show that the article referred particularly to him.",Recalling a fact or procedural event
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"His theory was that his role in the management of the Area was so prominent and important that the public regarded him as the man responsible for its operations, chargeable with its failures and to be credited with its successes.",Recalling a fact or procedural event
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"Thus, to prove the article referred to him, he showed the importance of his role; the same showing, at the least, raises a substantial argument that he was a ""public official."" [14]",Recalling a primary source (other than a SCOTUS decision)
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"The record here, however, leaves open the possibility that respondent could have adduced proofs to bring his claim outside the New York Times rule.",Stating the Court's reasoning
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"Moreover, even if the claim falls within New York Times, the record suggests respondent may be able to present a jury question of malice as there defined.",Stating the Court's reasoning
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"Because the trial here was had before New York Times, we have concluded that we should not foreclose him from attempting retrial of his *88 action.",Giving the holding/ruling of the Court
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,"We remark only that, as is the case with questions of privilege generally, it is for the trial judge in the first instance to determine whether the proofs show respondent to be a ""public official."" [15]",Giving the holding/ruling of the Court
ROSENBLATT v. BAER_MCL,The judgment is reversed and the case remanded to the New Hampshire Supreme Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.,Giving the holding/ruling of the Court

opinion-G16-(United States v.

opinion-G16-(United States v. Mississippi Chemical,The legislative history of the Farm Credit Act of 1955 indicates that Congress placed much of the blame for the Bank's inability to *309 repay the capital extended by the Government and to retain private capital on the provision in the 1933 legislation which permitted borrowers to redeem their stock for cash upon paying off their loans.,Referring to unwritten sources of authority

opinion-G16-(United States v. Mississippi Chemical,"In sum, every share of stock purchased quarterly by the taxpayers is nearly as valuable as the shares purchased initially.",Stating the Court's reasoning
opinion-G16-(United States v. Mississippi Chemical,It is therefore difficult to understand why these different purchases should receive radically different tax treatment.,Stating the Court's reasoning
opinion-G16-(United States v. Mississippi Chemical,"If Congress had required 1,000 or 100,000 shares of Class C stock to be purchased *310 before an association could borrow from the Banks, under the taxpayers' theory of the case the cost of those shares would be a nondeductible capital expense.",Stating the Court's reasoning

More than that, each and every one is a threat to his malehood and peace of mind, until at last, in a bar, he finds Ann-Margret, an aging bachelor girl with striking cleavage and, quite obviously, something of a past. `Why don't we shack up?' she suggests. They do and a horrendous relationship ensues, complicated mainly by her paranoidal desire to marry. Meanwhile, what of Garfunkel?
